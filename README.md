# Predicting Student Success Using Machine Learning 

This repository contains code and documentation for a project aimed at enhancing student success in the Turkish education system through data science and machine learning.

## Project Workflow

- Presented with the opportunity to contribute to a project focused on improving student success in the Turkish education system using data science and machine learning.
- Conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python's pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- Performed feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- Implemented various machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests) after splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Developed a robust data-driven model for predicting student success, leveraging insights from comprehensive data analysis.
- Demonstrated the interplay of various factors affecting student performance through machine learning algorithms.
