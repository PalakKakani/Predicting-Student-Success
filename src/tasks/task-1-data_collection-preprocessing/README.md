# Task 1 - Data collection and preprocessing
## After a few weeks of work and discussion, the data collection team decided to use the following datasets (already on this Github folder):
* student-mat.csv - 30 atributes + 3 math grades 
* student-por.csv - Same 30 attributes + 3 language (portuguese) grades
* student.txt - Schema
* student-merge.R - a simple R script for merging both datasets

## These datasets were downloaded from the following source:

* https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance

## We just unziped the downloaded file and commited to Github
